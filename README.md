# OmniFocus 3 Perspective Icons

By [Josh Hughes](http://josh-hughes.com)

**Note: This requires the Professional version of OmniFocus 2 for Mac or the latest TestFlight version of the OmniFocus 3 for iOS Public Beta**

[A test page of these icons can be accessed here](http://omnifocusicons.josh-hughes.com/v3/). This is very much a work in progress. Requests or feedback can be directed to [josh@josh-hughes.com](mailto:josh@josh-hughes.com).
