# OmniFocus 3 Perspective Icons

By [Josh Hughes](http://josh-hughes.com)

**Note: This requires the Professional version of OmniFocus 2 for Mac or the latest Testflight version of the OmniFocus 3 for iOS Public Beta**

This is very much a work in progress. As of this writing, I'm mostly working off of random screenshots to inform color and style choices, so until I can see what things look like in the actual software, everything is subject to change.
